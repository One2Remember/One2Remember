## Welcome!

My name is Emmanuel Gallegos. I'm a Siebel Scholar, Graduate Fellow, and current MS Computer Science student at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, with an expected graduation date in May 2023. I received my BS in Computer Science from CSU East Bay in the Fall of 2020.
 
My software engineering experience lies primarily in Android development, as well as computer vision, machine learning, and parallel programming. I'm currently researching parallel algorithms for multi-agent task and motion planning.
