## Welcome!

My name is Emmanuel Gallegos. I'm a Graduate Fellow and current MS Computer Science student at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, with an expected graduation date in
 May 2023. I got my BS in Computer Science from CSU East Bay in the Fall of 2020.
 
 My software engineering experience lies primarily in Android development, as well as computer vision, machine learning, and parallel programming. I'm currently beginning my 
 research into algorithmic optimization for smart city / smart car routing protocols.
